# Frequently Asked Questions
This page includes questions that were asked a lot in previous
and current versions of Nexus Admin. One or more may be able to
answer a question without having to get an answer.

## Where do I create support requests?
If the other questions answer your question, you shouldn't have
to do so. In the case that you still need support, GitHub issues
are best place since they are publicly searchable under the repository.
Private messages on services like Twitter are the next-best option since
they are in one place. Support on Roblox is not provided since
code can't be formatted.

## How do I insert Nexus Admin?
The easiest way to insert Nexus Admin into a game
is to obtain the [model on Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/library/392077186/Nexus-Admin)
and insert it into `ServerScriptService` of your game
using Roblox Studio.

## How do I make myself an admin?
If you are the owner of the game, you will automatically
have the highest level of admin. If you are inserting it
in Roblox Studio and it fails to load, it may be because
you need to own a copy of [source code](https://www.roblox.com/library/386507112/Nexus-Admin-Server-Code)
before Roblox will be able to insert it. This is not needed
for live games.

## How do I make others admins?
The configuration information is covered in the loader instead
of the docs. Support is not given for how to configure the loader,
but requests to improve or change the loader are accepted. Basic
questions like these either point to a problem that can be addressed
in the loader script or your own knowledge of Roblox Studio.

## How do I create a custom command?
See [Creating Commands](creating-commands.md). Support is not
provided on implementing commands.

## How do I (something related to Innovation Security's Commends System)?
Nexus Admin's business justification for existing was for
the Innovation Security Commends System. This however has
caused quite a few people to expect support for trying to
clone Innovation Security or provide access to proprietary
code owned by Innovation Security. You are free to use Nexus
Admin, but support will not be given for specific questions
regarding the Innovation Security Commends System.

## Are changes for the command line or Cmdr APIs accepted?
If there is request for a change that is specific to Cmdr,
such as the Cmdr API, argument parsing (excluding `nexusAdminPlayers`),
or the Cmdr command line user interface, it should me made on
the [Cmdr repository](https://github.com/evaera/Cmdr). If the
feature exists in a newer release than Nexus Admin uses, a request
can be made to update it.
