# Nexus-Admin
Nexus Admin is admin system built on top of [Cmdr](https://github.com/evaera/Cmdr)
to simplify load and add additional functionality, including
a built in UI. Included is an API for registering custom commands
for integration into games that require more than what Cmdr offers.

## Should I Just Use Cmdr?
Nexus Admins adds additional functionality that may be useful through
some of it's modules, like fast flags and authorization. If none of the
additional features or commands are needed and the more involved setup
is acceptable for a lighter weight system, Cmdr should be considered.
